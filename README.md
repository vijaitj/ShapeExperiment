# ShapeExperiment
Contains files required to run the experiment mentioned in the paper: Perception of 3D Symmetrical and Nearly Symmetrical Shapes (https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/10/8/344/htm).  In this study, stimuli were generated using the game engine Unity (known commonly as Unity3D). To display the stimuli, we used Oculus Rift, a virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display.
